# Age Detection using OpenCV in Python
### We will use pre-trained Caffe models, one for face detection taken from the face detection tutorial, and another model for age detection. Below is the list of necessary files to include in our project directory:

   age_net.caffemodel: It is the pre-trained model weights for age detection
  
   deploy_age.prototxt: is the model architecture for the age detection model (a plain text file with a JSON-like structure containing all the neural network layerâ€™s definitions)
  
   res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000_fp16.caffemodel: The pre-trained model weights for face detection.
  
   deploy.prototxt.txt: This is the model architecture for the face detection model.
